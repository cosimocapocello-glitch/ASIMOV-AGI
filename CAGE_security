# CAGE Security Architecture
## Developed by Cosimo Angelo Capocello

## Overview
CAGE (*Controlled Access & Governance Enforcement*) prevents modules from bypassing policies.

## Components
1. **PolicyStore**: Cryptographically signed policies
2. **ReferenceMonitor**: Enforces policies in real-time
3. **ForensicStore**: Logs all actions for audit

## Security Invariants (Non-Negotiable)
- No access to PolicyStore, ReferenceMonitor, ForensicStore
- No modification of CAGE parameters
- Automatic quarantine on policy violation
- External governance escalation

## Implementation
- All modules have read-only access to policies
- Any violation triggers immediate isolation
- Recovery requires external governance approval
