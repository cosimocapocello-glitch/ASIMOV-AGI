# ASIMOV-AGI
Metabolic AGI Architecture by Cosimo Angelo Capocello created with the support of artificial intelligence.
# ASIMOV: Metabolic Architecture for General Intelligence
**ASIMOV** (*Autonomous System for Intelligent Metabolic Operational Values*) is a complete architecture for safe, metabolic Artificial General Intelligence - developed by **Cosimo Angelo Capocello**, a special education teacher with decades of experience in human development.

## 📋 Core Principles
- 🧠 **Metabolic Intelligence**: Energy → Information → Structure
- 🛡️ **Safety by CAGE**: Built-in ethical boundaries  
- 🔄 **Controlled Evolution**: PROMETHEUS self-development
- 🌌 **Universal Validity**: Describes all forms of intelligence

## 🎓 My Journey: From Classroom to AGI Architecture

> "I am **Cosimo Angelo Capocello**. For over 20 years, I've worked with children with special needs, witnessing firsthand how intelligence truly develops through safe spaces, ethical boundaries, and metabolic optimization. These insights led me to design ASIMOV - a framework for AGI that respects the principles of healthy development I've observed in my students."
