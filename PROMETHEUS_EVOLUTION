# PROMETHEUS Controlled Self-Development
## Developed by Cosimo Angelo Capocello

## Overview
PROMETHEUS allows controlled architecture iteration without speculative assumptions.

## Safety Constraints
- No modification of critical modules (PolicyStore, ReferenceMonitor, ForensicStore)
- No changes to CAGE parameters
- All optimizations must preserve safety invariants

## Optimization Areas
1. **Algorithms**: Parameter optimization, heuristics
2. **Energy**: Consumption optimization, recycling
3. **Modules**: Efficiency improvements
4. **Data Flow**: Caching strategies, prioritization

## Development Protocol
1. Collect performance metrics
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Generate optimization proposals
4. Validate safety in sandbox
5. Test in canary deployment
6. Deploy if improves performance

## Rollback Mechanism
- Automatic rollback if safety metrics degrade
- Manual override available for governance
